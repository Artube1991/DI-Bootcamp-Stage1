    <p><strong>Moby</strong> (birth name Richard Melville Hall) is an American musician, songwriter, record producer, DJ and animal rights activist. He has sold 20 million records worldwide. AllMusic considers him to be "among the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United States and the United Kingdom".</p>
    <p>Moby found commercial and critical success with his third album "Play" (1999) which, after receiving little recognition, became an unexpected global hit in 2000 after each track was licensed to films, television shows, and commercials. It remains his highest selling album with 12 million copies sold. Moby followed "Play" with albums of varied styles including electronic, dance, rock, and downtempo music, starting with "18" (2002) and "Hotel" (2005). His later albums (since 2016) saw him explore ambient music.</p>
